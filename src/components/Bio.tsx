        <span className="text-3xl">Kristen Yong</span> is a Latin American writer passionate about storytelling,
        mythology, and emotional worldbuilding. She is the author of The Frost
        and The Flame, a dramatic danmei fantasy set in an eternal winter
        kingdom inspired by Joseon Korea. With lyrical prose and intense
        character-driven plots, her work blends romance, political intrigue, and
        spiritual folklore. Her stories explore themes of identity, power, and
        longing â€” often through flawed heroes facing impossible choices. Kristen
        believes that fantasy is a mirror to our deepest truths, and she writes
        to connect with readers who seek beauty in darkness and meaning in
        silence. Currently, she is expanding her reach to international
        platforms such as Tapas and Webnovel, where she shares her stories in
        English for a global audience.
